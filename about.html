    <h1>About Vortex Energy</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight">Vortex Energy</span> is a next-generation energy drink designed for people who demand clean fuel for both mind and body. While traditional energy drinks often rely on synthetic additives and overload you with sugar, Vortex offers a smarter solution. Our drink is based on <span class="highlight">coconut water</span> — a natural source of hydration — and enhanced with functional ingredients like <span class="highlight">natural caffeine</span>, <span class="highlight">methylated B12</span>, and <span class="highlight">L-Tryptophan</span>.</p>

    <p>Whether you're deep in study mode, heading to the gym, or starting your day, Vortex supports your energy and mental clarity — without the crash. It's crafted for students, athletes, creators, and thinkers who want to feel sharper, calmer, and more focused throughout the day.</p>

    <p>Born out of a desire to offer an alternative to overloaded, artificial formulas, Vortex Energy is more than a drink — it's a movement towards <span class="highlight">clean, purposeful energy</span>. No crash. No compromises. Just clarity.</p>
